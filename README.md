**Design Lead:**  Adira Rana

**Testing Lead:** Michael Carrillo

## Tools and Materials

### Engine
We plan to use the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for rendering 3D objects in JavaScript. This is largely due to the community surrounding it and the documentation that has arisen from that popularity. With many of our options being completely unknown by many of us, this documentation will come in especially handy. Additionally, we would like to pair it with [ammo.js](https://kripken.github.io/ammo.js/) as our physics library, as after some research, it has been widely used alongside three.js in several projects, proving that these two libraries work well together. Our final platform will be on the web using GitHub pages to deploy our project (in tandem with GitHub’s codespaces), chosen to continue the direction of web development that we have taken in CMPM 121 up until now. Additionally, the web is widely accessible, making it easy to share with others for playtesting

### Language
Our team plans on working in Javascript or Typescript. The reason we chose what we did is because of the ease of use as we as a team have already spent a comfortable amount of time using the language to make a project in it. Additionally the engines we chose work in Javascript and Typescript.

### Tools
In terms of tools, we will probably attempt to use the editor provided on the [three.js page](https://threejs.org/). We are also likely going to continue to use the IDE’s we’ve been using throughout the class. We make these choices because it provides us room to learn further with typeScript and javaScript while also allowing us to have a bit of familiarity with what tools we are using. It also does not seem like we as a group have too much experience with 3D editors, so it might be helpful to use one associated with the platform we are using. If not the provided editor by three.js, we have a little bit of Blender knowledge on our team.

### Generative AI
Our plan when it comes to Generative AI to use it as an assistant tool. We’ll use either ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to explain any confusing errors that might pop up during the development process. We want the Generative AI to assist us, not make the game. We won’t ask it to complete full sections of code, or look through an entire file and tell it to edit the mistake that’s within. Since Copilot tends to write in the code directly, we can always review the code to make sure we understand it first before fully implementing it into our code.

## Outlook
We aren’t sure what type of game we’re planning to make, but we do know that we want to build something that uses the three.js as well as possibly, ammo.js. We think the hardest part of this project will more than likely be understanding three.js and ammo.js for the first time. Since most of the projects for CMPM 121 have been mostly only TypeScript and 2D. Since we don’t know our game project idea, we’re hoping that this project helps us understand how these systems work and hopefully teaches us how to properly organize a project.
